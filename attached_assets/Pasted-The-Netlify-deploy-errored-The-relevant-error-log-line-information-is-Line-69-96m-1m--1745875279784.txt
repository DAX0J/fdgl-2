Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by Vite being unable to load a specific file `src/components/AdminDashboard` during the build process.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the file `src/components/AdminDashboard` is present in the repository and committed to the Git repository.
2. If the file is present, add `src/components/AdminDashboard` to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration in your `vite.config.js` file to exclude it from the Vite build process.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the build failure.
